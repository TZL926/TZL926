Hi, I'm sye  
I focus on practical penetration testing — from web to internal networks, and eventually into binary exploitation.  
Currently building custom tools to support hands-on learning and real-world engagements.

Persistence beats resistance.  
Every system has a weakness; it’s just a matter of finding it.  
Exploit the impossible, master the unknown.  
Behind every lock is a logic waiting to be broken.  
Attack smart, defend stronger.  
Learning is the ultimate exploit.  
The best backdoors are the ones you build yourself.  
Hack to understand, not to destroy.
